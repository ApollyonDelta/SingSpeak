I have lost myself. I have worshiped at your feet. And here I am standing on top of the world with some ditches to the feet. I played the game. I've won it all. They screen my name. They bought the doll. I see it's the day. It's not there. Kenneth wants to stay in AA. Fuck you. Give my 2 minute notice. Fuck you. Thanks to clean. And now the roses say goodbye. While I look you, Wendy. I am saying fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. I have taken sheet. I'm crushed under your heel. I have circled for profit and circled for fame. Made a fortune. You could steal. I had enough. I hit the wall. I'm tired of taking your calls. Eating today. Now there's just one thing to say, hey. Hey. Fuck you. I wish I said it sooner for you. Cut you off just like a tumor. Hope you die. Yes. May I ask to buy your clock for you? Have yourself a container doing the same shit every day when an angle belongs, being shipped for a policy or sick of a bank. If you're ever for the same, I'm here to say it. Did you really think I was gonna stay? Stanley and left handover, which are fist in my ass. Blender me, say, I'm never working this time. This past the camera, and I'll be 6 more feet under the ground.
